## Project Overview for the Drag and drop file uploader

## What is a drag and drop file uploader?
- A drag and drop file uploader is a basic component that allows you to drag folders or even files into the component which by default will act as a drop area element. The drop area gets highlighted when you drag folders or even files into the drop area.

### Functionality of the app(HTML and CSS or any other framework).
- Users should be able to see where to drag or upload the file.
    - An icon should be very clear on the component that will show that this is about uploading a file or something else.
    - Text showing the user what to do with the uploader should be seen clearly.
    - For users with Big devices the functionality of both drag and drop should both be available but for users with phones only the upload feature should be available since phone users do not have drag capabilities.
    
### Tech stack
- Basically, this component will be fully functional and fully fledged when you use html, css and javaScript but for this one since it is just an assignment for design and practice of the design process, we will just html and CSS or any framework of your choice.
